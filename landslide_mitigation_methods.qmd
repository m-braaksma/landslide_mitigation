## Description

Landslide mitigation represents a critical regulating ecosystem service provided by forests through slope stabilization and erosion control. Forests reduce landslide risk through multiple mechanisms: root systems bind soil particles together, canopy cover reduces surface erosion from precipitation, and vegetation slows water infiltration rates. This ecosystem service is particularly valuable in mountainous and hilly regions where human populations are exposed to landslide hazards. Our analysis quantifies this service specifically in terms of avoided landslide mortality, measuring how forest cover prevents human fatalities that would otherwise occur due to landslide events.

## Methods

Building on the methodology outlined in [@brander2018mapping], we develop the first global methodology to quantify avoided landslide mortality in a given year. Our approach integrates multiple datasets to construct a comprehensive understanding of landslide risk factors and forest protection effects.

### Data Sources and Variables {.unnumbered}

| Data | Source | Variable Description |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| LULC | ESA-CCI [@ESA2017LandCoverCCI] | Land use/land cover including forest extent |
| Population | WorldPop [@WorldPopUnconstrainedGlobalMosaics2000_2020] | Gridded population data accounting for human exposure |
| Landslide Mortality | EM-DAT - The international disaster database | Annual records of landslide-related fatalities |
| Admin 2 Borders | FAO GAUL 2015 | Administrative boundaries linked to EM-DAT |
| Precipitation | MODIS ERA5 | Annual precipitation data for weather variation |
| Value of Statistical Life (VSL) | USDOT | GDP-adjusted VSL for economic valuation |
| SDR inputs | NatCap TEEMs | Basins, elevation, soil data for sediment export modeling |

### Analytical Approach{.unnumbered}

We construct a historic panel dataset at the administrative-2 level combining mortality data from EM-DAT with sediment export estimates from InVEST's SDR model, which incorporates forest cover effects. The analysis accounts for population exposure using WorldPop data and weather variability through ERA5 precipitation records.

From this integrated dataset, we estimate a mortality function using:

$$M_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ln(S_{it}) + \beta_2 ln(P_{it}) + \beta_3 ln(R_{it}) + \lambda_t + \epsilon_{it}$$

where:
- $M_{it}$ = count of landslide-related mortalities in region $i$ at time $t$
- $ln(S_{it})$ = natural log of sediment export sum
- $ln(P_{it})$ = natural log of total population
- $ln(R_{it})$ = natural log of total precipitation
- $\lambda_t$ = year fixed effects
- $\epsilon_{it}$ = error term

Each observation represents an administrative-2 region $i$ in year $t \in [2000, 2020]$.

### Valuation Method {.unnumbered}

To estimate the economic value of landslide mitigation, we employ a GDP-adjusted Value of Statistical Life (VSL) approach. Using the estimated coefficients from the mortality function, we calculate avoided mortality by comparing predicted mortality under a counterfactual scenario (without forest cover) to the observed scenario (with current forest cover). The difference in mortality is then valued using country-specific VSL estimates.

# Methods


## Estimating Quantity

Building on the methodology outlined in [Brander et al.], we develop the first global methodology to quantify avoided landslide mortality in a given year. To estimate the quantity of deaths caused by landslides, we start by constructing a historic panel dataset. Mortality data is sourced from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), which provides annual records of landslide-related fatalities at the administrative 2 level. The other key data source is the sediment export based on InVEST's SDR model, which accounts for forest cover. Also included is gridded population data from WorldPop, which accounts for the fact that mortality only occurs where people reside. Finally, ERA5 precipitation data is included to account for annual variation in weather, which may also impact landslides. These data are combined to create an annual admin-2 level dataset. 

From this data, a mortality function is estimated using:

$$
M_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ln(S_{it}) + \beta_2 ln(P_{it}) + \beta_3 ln(R_{it}) + \lambda_t + \epsilon_{it}
$$

where each $M_{it}$ is the count of landslide related mortalities, $ln(S_{it})$ is the sum of sediment export, $ln(P_{it})$ is the total population, $ln(R_{it})$ is the sum of total precipitation, and $\lambda_t$ is the year fixed effect. Each observation represents a regional unit $i$ at the adminsitrative level 2 designation in a given year $t \in [2000, 2020]$.

observation is an administrative 2 region $i$ in year $t$. 

Finally, using the coefficients from this function, we estimate avoided mortality in the desired year by taking predicted mortality under a counterfactual forest cover scenario less observed forest cover. 


## Valuation

To estimate the value of landslide mitigation, we employ a GDP-adjusted value of a staistical life (VSL).
